        Instructions to teacher:
            Introduction:
            Begin the session by engaging the students in a relatable scenario.
            "Imagine you're in a village, surrounded by the simplicity of life. Now, let's explore how the
            world of networking and cybersecurity can make this village life even more secure,
            connected, and fascinating."
                Networking in Village Life:
                    ● Communication and Connectivity:
                        ○  Explain how networking connects people and devices. In the village context, it
                        helps in communicating with neighboring villages, sharing information, and
                        collaborating for community activities.
                    ● Resource Sharing:
                        ○ Describe how a network can be like a virtual marketplace for villagers,
                        facilitating the exchange of resources, agricultural tools, and knowledge.
                Cybersecurity in Village Life:
                    ● Securing Information:
                        ○ Emphasize the importance of keeping personal and community information
                        safe from potential threats. Discuss how cybersecurity measures protect
                        against unauthorized access.
        Class Settings:
            Begin the class by discussing how networking connects computers and enhances
            communication. Highlight the importance of cybersecurity in keeping information
            safe online.

                Student handbook
                Computer
            Student arrangement in the class
                Students sit in class on benches and chairs. Give opportunities to all students to be part of
                the discussion related to the topics.
            Explanation of the Topics:

        Questions to ask from Students (on each topic)
            Projects/tasks to encourage students to develop an understanding of the topic (for
            each topic)
            Networking and Its Types:
                1. What is networking, and why is it important for devices to communicate?
                2. Can you explain the difference between a local area network (LAN) and a wide area
                    network (WAN)?
            Cloud Computing:
                1. What is cloud computing, and how does it differ from using only your computer?
                2. How might cloud computing be helpful for students in a village school?
