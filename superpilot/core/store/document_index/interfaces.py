        Takes a list of document chunks and indexes them in the document index

        NOTE: When a document is reindexed/updated here, it must clear all of the existing document
        chunks before reindexing. This is because the document may have gotten shorter since the
        last run. Therefore, upserting the first 0 through n chunks may leave some old chunks that
        have not been written over.

        NOTE: The chunks of a document are never separated into separate index() calls. So there is
        no worry of receiving the first 0 through n chunks in one index call and the next n through
        m chunks of a docu in the next index call.

        NOTE: Due to some asymmetry between the primary and secondary indexing logic, this function
        only needs to index chunks into the PRIMARY index. Do not update the secondary index here,
        it is done automatically outside of this code.

        Parameters:
